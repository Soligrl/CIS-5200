# ðŸ“¥ Redfin Data Upload Instructions

This guide explains how we downloaded, converted, and uploaded the Redfin housing market dataset to HDFS for use in Hive.

---

## Step 1: Download Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Redfin Housing Market Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thuynyle/redfin-housing-market-data)
- After download, locate the zip file on your machine (we renamed ours to `Redfin.zip`)

---

## Step 2: Unzip in Git Bash
```bash
unzip Redfin.zip -d redfin_data
```
- You should see 5 `.tsv000` files extracted

---

## Step 3: Navigate into Directory
```bash
cd redfin_data
```

---

## Step 4: Convert .TSV to .CSV
```bash
for file in *.tsv000; do
  cat "$file" | tr '\t' ',' > "${file%.tsv000}.csv"
done
```

---

## Step 5: Verify Converted Files
```bash
ls *.csv
```
Expected output:
- `county_market_tracker.csv`
- `neighborhood_market_tracker.csv`
- `state_market_tracker.csv`
- `us_national_market_tracker.csv`
- `zip_code_market_tracker.csv`

---

## Step 6: Transfer Files to Remote Server
```bash
scp *.csv sruiz85@144.24.13.0:~
```
Repeat for any failed transfers individually.

---

## Step 7: Verify Upload via SSH
```bash
ssh sruiz85@144.24.13.0
ls ~/*.csv
```
You should see all five `.csv` files in your home directory.

---

## Step 8: Create HDFS Target Directory
```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/sruiz85/Group5-Project
```

---

## Step 9: Move Files to HDFS
```bash
hdfs dfs -put ~/county_market_tracker.csv /user/sruiz85/Group5-Project/
hdfs dfs -put ~/neighborhood_market_tracker.csv /user/sruiz85/Group5-Project/
hdfs dfs -put ~/state_market_tracker.csv /user/sruiz85/Group5-Project/
hdfs dfs -put ~/us_national_market_tracker.csv /user/sruiz85/Group5-Project/
hdfs dfs -put ~/zip_code_market_tracker.csv /user/sruiz85/Group5-Project/
```

Once complete, your Redfin CSV files will be ready for Hive processing!
